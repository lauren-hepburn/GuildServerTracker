# GuildServerTracker
 Simple discord bot. Keeps track of guilds and their home channels in BDO or other games.

 Created with repl.it for my own personal use.

 Commands include:
    $help - lists commands
    $addguild <guildname> <mainchannel> - adds a guild and their main channel. Will overwrite previous data
    $delguild <guildname> - deletes guild specified
    $guild <guildname> - lists main server for guild specified
    $listguilds - lists all guilds and main servers
